# From Windows 2 Linux

Before I dive into my journey, here’s the no-nonsense truth from my experience:

- Windows and Linux aren’t magic different worlds — they are both just operating systems. They boot your hardware, run your programs, manage files, and give you a desktop or terminal to interact with. The difference is in **how they get you there**. Windows likes to make some decisions for you, Linux often gives you the wheel.  

So what's a "distro"?  

- A distro (short for distribution) is basically a **ready-to-go package of Linux**: the kernel, system tools, a desktop environment, app repositories, and a package manager. Think of it like coffee: same basic bean (the Linux kernel), but different roast, equipment, and barista. Each distro tastes a little different, some are strong, some are sweet, some require effort to make — but all get you caffeinated in the end.

## My story 

I first touched Linux back in **2008**. I had been curious for years but was intimidated — until I requested a free Ubuntu CD just to play with it. I installed it, poked around, loved the idea… but honestly, back then it felt a bit rough. Apps were missing, updates were sometimes buggy, and I needed stability for my work. So, I went back to Windows (and occasionally Mac), but Linux stuck in my mind.  

By **2010–2011**, I got pulled back in through **BackTrack** (later Kali Linux). This was my “deep end of the pool” moment. I learned to love the terminal, scripts, and the sense of control Linux gave me. It wasn’t just an OS anymore — it was a playground for learning.  

By **2013**, I made the full leap to Ubuntu. Finally, I could do my daily work entirely in Linux. Windows became my backup for rare edge cases: a legacy game here, a phone-flashing tool there.  

Between **2014 and 2022**, I bounced between Mint, Debian, and Fedora, always looking for something smoother, faster, or more customizable. Finally, in **2022**, I took on **Arch Linux**. The installation alone felt like an achievement. Complex? Yes. Frustrating? Sometimes. Rewarding? Absolutely. And I’ve never looked back.

## TL;DR — Why this matters

Here’s the personal summary from my experience:  

- [Last Good Windows](#last-good-windows) — Windows 7 was the sweet spot; after that, things started feeling heavy and unstable.  
- [Choosing a Version of Linux](#choosing-a-version-of-linux) — Pick a distro that suits your personality and patience. Mint is gentle, Arch is a challenge.  
- [What Are the Differences?](#what-are-the-differences) — Linux can do everything Windows does, but with different paths, tools, and ways to interact.  
- [Which Desktop Environment?](#which-desktop-environment) — The desktop matters — it’s your visual workspace.  
- [What About My Windows Apps?](#what-about-my-windows-apps) — Most apps exist cross-platform, others can be replaced with excellent free/open-source alternatives.

### Last Good Windows

For me, the last really solid version of Windows was **Windows 7**. I mean, it just worked. It didn’t nag me constantly with updates, it didn’t slow down with mysterious background processes, and I felt in control.  

After that, things changed. Windows 8 and later felt heavier, more opinionated, and sometimes unpredictable. Updates that shouldn’t break anything… broke things. Telemetry, forced upgrades, and a constantly shifting interface made me feel like I was losing touch with my own computer.  

💡 **Tip:** Keep a virtual machine with Windows 7 if you need old apps, but don’t expect it to be your main driver anymore.

### Choosing a Version of Linux

A Linux distro is your **personal flavor of Linux**. My approach: start simple, explore, then decide if you want to dive deeper. Here’s my perspective:  

- **Linux Mint** — My personal recommendation for beginners. Smooth, stable, and very Windows-friendly. Easy to transition into.  
- **Ubuntu** — Great community support and lots of tutorials. A good second step if Mint feels too “basic.”  
- **Fedora** — Cutting-edge tech, frequent updates. Fun if you like experimenting.  
- **Arch Linux** — My ultimate challenge. Full control, full responsibility. Not for the faint of heart, but incredibly rewarding.  

Pick a distro based on **how much control you want versus how much convenience you need**.

### What Are the Differences?

Windows and Linux do the **same essential stuff**: browse the web, edit documents, watch videos, play games, write code. But the paths they take differ:  

- **File system & paths** — Linux uses `/home/username` instead of `C:\Users\name`. Permissions are more granular.  
- **Terminal power** — A few simple commands can replace dozens of mouse clicks. Once you get comfortable, Linux feels way faster.  
- **Software & philosophy** — Windows has closed apps, Linux has open-source freedom. Sometimes you trade familiarity for flexibility, but I found it worth it.  

Personally, once I learned a handful of terminal commands, I felt like I was **running my computer instead of being run by it**.

### Which Desktop Environment?

The desktop environment (DE) is the **face of your Linux system** — the part you interact with visually. My favorites:  

- **Cinnamon** — smooth, intuitive, very Windows-like. My go-to for beginners and Mint users.  
- **Gnome** — modern and sleek, slightly different workflow.  
- **XFCE** — lightweight, minimal, fast — perfect for older hardware.  
- Others like **KDE** or **Unity** offer advanced customization if you like tinkering.  

Choosing the DE is like choosing your office layout: it affects comfort, efficiency, and style.

### What About My Windows Apps?

This is the scary part for most people moving to Linux: leaving behind familiar apps. Here’s my take:  

- Many essentials exist cross-platform: **Firefox, Chrome, VLC**, etc.  
- Free and open-source alternatives are often **even better**:  
  - Microsoft Office → **LibreOffice** or **OpenOffice**  
  - Outlook → **Thunderbird**  
  - Photoshop → **GIMP**  
- For legacy Windows apps, **Wine** or a virtual machine works surprisingly well.  

After switching, I realized most apps I loved were actually free in Linux. I never looked back — the software freedom feels amazing.
