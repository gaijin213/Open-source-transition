# From Windows 2 Linux

Before I tell my story, a quick no-nonsense truth:

- Windows and Linux are not magic different universes — they are both operating systems. Both boot your hardware, run your programs, manage files, and give you a desktop or a terminal to interact with. They just take different roads to get to the same place. One uses different defaults, different tools, and different assumptions about control and freedom.

So what's a "distro" then?

- A distro (short for distribution) is a packaged version of Linux: the kernel, a set of system tools, desktop environments, app repositories, and a package manager — all bundled together with defaults and documentation. Think of distros like different flavours of coffee: same basic bean (the Linux kernel), different roast, different equipment, and a different barista's touch.

## My story 

I first actually tried Linux in 2008. I’d heard about it for years but never dared to try — until I requested a free Ubuntu CD to try it out. I installed Ubuntu, poked around, loved the idea… but back then the ecosystem still felt thin: some apps were missing, and the system could be unstable for my needs. I went back to Windows (and sometimes Mac) while keeping Linux in the back of my head.

At the end of 2010 / start of 2011 I got hooked again through BackTrack (later Kali Linux) — the penetration-testing spins based on Debian/Ubuntu. Those distros pulled me deeper into the community and into doing things from the terminal.

By 2013 I moved fully to Ubuntu. It felt stable, the package repos were great, and I realised I could actually live in Linux day-to-day. Since then, Windows became a backup for niche tasks: a few phone-flashing tools and the occasional 90s game that only runs on Windows.

After 2014 I bounced mostly between Linux Mint and Ubuntu, tried Fedora occasionally, and spent years on Mint and Debian. Then, in 2022, I wanted to push myself further: I installed Arch from the terminal. It was complex, rewarding, and borderline glorious — completing that install felt like an achievement. I stayed on Arch and never looked back. Yes, it's not the easiest distro when things break, but I love the challenge and control.

## TL;DR — Why this matters

- [Last Good Windows](#last-good-windows) — Windows 7 was stable; modern versions often feel heavier and more restrictive.  
- [Choosing a Version of Linux](#choosing-a-version-of-linux) — Distros are curated Linux packages; pick one that suits your comfort level and goals.  
- [What Are the Differences?](#what-are-the-differences) — Core functions are the same, but Linux has different file systems, terminal workflows, and software models.  
- [Which Desktop Environment?](#which-desktop-environment) — The GUI layer affects your workflow; Cinnamon, Gnome, and XFCE are popular.  
- [What About My Windows Apps?](#what-about-my-windows-apps) — Most apps exist cross-platform or have free/open-source equivalents.

### Last Good Windows

For me, the last truly stable and reliable version of Windows was **Windows 7**. It offered a predictable interface, stable updates, and decent performance. After Windows 7, Microsoft introduced changes that made the system feel heavier, more restrictive, and sometimes unpredictable with updates and privacy settings. Many users who relied on stability felt frustrated with forced upgrades, telemetry, and evolving UI decisions.

**Tips for Windows users:**  
- Keep Windows 7 in a virtual machine if needed for legacy apps.  
- Consider Linux as your main system if you want stability, speed, and control.

### Choosing a Version of Linux

A Linux distribution (or “distro”) is a **curated package of Linux software, desktop environment, and management tools**. Popular choices include:  

- **Linux Mint** — beginner-friendly, familiar interface, smooth transition from Windows.  
- **Ubuntu** — widely supported, strong community, great for desktops and servers.  
- **Fedora** — cutting-edge software, frequent updates, and Red Hat ecosystem.  
- **Arch Linux** — highly customizable, ideal for advanced users who want full control.  

**Advice:** Start with Mint or Ubuntu if you are transitioning from Windows. Experimenting with Fedora or Arch is great once you are comfortable with Linux fundamentals.

### What Are the Differences?

While Windows and Linux do the **same fundamental jobs**, there are notable differences:  

- **File System & Paths**: Linux uses `/home/username` instead of `C:\Users\name`, and permissions are more granular.  
- **Terminal Power**: Many tasks (updates, batch operations, system tweaks) are faster using the terminal. Learning a few commands will dramatically improve productivity.  
- **Software Ecosystem**: Some Windows-only apps exist, but Linux offers powerful free/open-source alternatives.  

Linux tends to be more stable, less prone to crashes, and often faster for older hardware. Once you understand the workflow differences, it can feel liberating and efficient.

### Which Desktop Environment?

The **desktop environment (DE)** is your graphical interface on Linux. It defines menus, panels, window behavior, and overall style.  

- **Cinnamon** — most Windows-like; intuitive for new users.  
- **Gnome** — modern, sleek, workflow-focused; slightly different from Windows.  
- **XFCE** — lightweight and fast; excellent for older PCs or minimal setups.  
- **KDE, Unity** — alternative choices with advanced customization.  

Your choice affects usability, system resource consumption, and aesthetics. Cinnamon is usually best for a smooth transition from Windows.

### What About My Windows Apps?

A common concern when switching is **losing your familiar apps**. Fortunately:  

- Many essential programs exist cross-platform (Firefox, Chrome, VLC).  
- Open-source alternatives cover most use cases:  
  - Microsoft Office → **LibreOffice** or **OpenOffice**  
  - Outlook → **Thunderbird**  
  - Photoshop → **GIMP**  
- Some Windows apps run in Linux using **Wine** or **virtual machines**.  

The Linux ecosystem emphasizes **free and open-source software**, reducing costs and increasing control while offering similar or better functionality.
