# From Windows 2 Linux

Before I tell my story, a quick no-nonsense truth:

- Windows and Linux are not magic different universes — they are both operating systems. Both boot your hardware, run your programs, manage files, and give you a desktop or a terminal to interact with. They just take different roads to get to the same place. One uses different defaults, different tools, and different assumptions about control and freedom.

So what's a "distro" then?
- A distro (short for distribution) is a packaged version of Linux: the kernel, a set of system tools, desktop environments, app repositories, and a package manager — all bundled together with defaults and documentation. Think of distros like different flavours of coffee: same basic bean (the Linux kernel), different roast, different equipment, and a different barista's touch.

## My story 

I first actually tried Linux in 2008. I’d heard about it for years but never dared to try — until I requested a free Ubuntu CD to try it out. I installed Ubuntu, poked around, loved the idea… but back then the ecosystem still felt thin: some apps were missing, and the system could be unstable for my needs. I went back to Windows (and sometimes Mac) while keeping Linux in the back of my head.

At the end of 2010 / start of 2011 I got hooked again through BackTrack (later Kali Linux) — the penetration-testing spins based on Debian/Ubuntu. Those distros pulled me deeper into the community and into doing things from the terminal.

By 2013 I moved fully to Ubuntu. It felt stable, the package repos were great, and I realised I could actually live in Linux day-to-day. Since then, Windows became a backup for niche tasks: a few phone-flashing tools and the occasional 90s game that only runs on Windows.

After 2014 I bounced mostly between Linux Mint and Ubuntu, tried Fedora occasionally, and spent years on Mint and Debian. Then, in 2022, I wanted to push myself further: I installed Arch from the terminal. It was complex, rewarding, and borderline glorious — completing that install felt like an achievement. I stayed on Arch and never looked back. Yes, it's not the easiest distro when things break, but I love the challenge and control.

## TL;DR — Why this matters
- Windows and Linux do the same core jobs — but Linux gives you options, visibility, and control.
- Distros are just curated collections of Linux software and defaults — pick one that matches how much control you want.
- My path: curiosity → Ubuntu trial (2008) → BackTrack/Kali (2010–2011) → full-time Ubuntu (2013) → Mint/Debian/Fedora experiments → Arch (2022) → happily staying on Arch.
- Windows is for backup / edge cases; Linux is my daily driver.

If you want this trimmed, expanded, or turned into a short "about" blurb for a web page, I can adapt it to any length or tone — punchier, more technical, or more beginner-friendly.
