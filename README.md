# The Open-source transition

Welcome 👋 to my personal chronicle: **from the days of DOS and Windows, proprietary software to the boundless world of Linux and open-source freedom!**

## 🚀 My Evolution: From Locked to Liberated

I began my computer journey in an age when software came in boxes in the beginning of the 90's, manuals were thicker than the computers they ran on, and DOS prompts reigned supreme. Soon, I experienced the magic (and sometimes frustration!) of Windows, discovering the polished, mysterious realm of closed source software.

But curiosity runs deep! As years passed, I started pushing past those digital barriers. The Linux penguin caught my eye—and suddenly, a bright, borderless world of **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)** opened up.

- **From DOS to Windows:** The start was all about learning, curiosity, and playing by the proprietary rules.
- **Discovering Linux:** I was hooked—tinkering, customizing, truly *owning* my environment.
- **FOSS FTW:** Embracing community-driven apps—tools built by and for passionate people.
- **Self-Hosting Everything:** Why rely on someone else’s server? I moved my digital life from corporate cloud silos to self-hosted, private services on my own hardware.

## 🌍 Why Open Source?

Because *freedom* matters. Because *privacy* matters. Because technology should serve **us**, not the other way around.

Here, I share my tools, setups, stories, and successes. Maybe you’re thinking about breaking free—or maybe you’re already knee-deep in self-hosting containers and compiling your own kernels. Either way, I hope my journey offers insights, inspiration, and the occasional laugh.

From F-Droid alternatives to de-Googling your phone, I'm committed to sharing guides, app lists, and tips to maximize open source adoption across all your devices.
