# My Yunohost Discovery: Self-Hosting Made Simple

Five years ago, my open-source journey took an exciting turn when I stumbled upon [YunoHost](https://yunohost.org/): an operating system based on Debian Linux, crafted to help people easily self-host both famous and lesser-known alternatives to proprietary web services.

## 🌱 Why Yunohost Caught My Eye

Back then, I was searching for tools that could put my data and my digital life back into **my hands**—not in the hands of corporations. I wanted to move away from expensive SaaS models, walled gardens, and data-hungry platforms, but traditional self-hosting was often daunting or time-consuming.

Enter Yunohost: a system designed specifically for non-experts and tinkerers alike. You install it just like Debian, but you get a beautiful control panel, single sign-on for all your apps, a huge catalog of ready-to-install software, and easy automatic updates—almost like running your personal, privacy-friendly cloud.

## 🚀 What is Yunohost?

- Based on [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/)
- Open source and community-driven
- Aims to make self-hosting accessible for everyone
- Web-based (and command line) UI for all admin tasks
- Install apps (and remove them) in one click
